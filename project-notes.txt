1) Plan and Create Front-End- 0:00
    The front-end will utilize the React Framework.
    Run this script at the root directory:
        npm install create-react-app -g
    Then run this script to create the cient:
        create-react-app client
    Within the client directory add material-ui:
        npm install @material-ui/core

    Inside the component API section of the material-ui docs, copy the import for 
    typography and add it to a component of jobs.

    The set-up is App.js will hold the application/use state which calling the hooks, 
    jobs.js will hold the component tree plus render styling.
