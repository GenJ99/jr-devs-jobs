1) Plan and Create Front-End- 0:00
    The front-end will utilize the React Framework.
    Run this script at the root directory:
        npm install create-react-app -g
    Then run this script to create the cient:
        create-react-app client
    Within the client directory add material-ui:
        npm install @material-ui/core

    Inside the component API section of the material-ui docs, copy the import for 
    typography and add it to a component of jobs.

    The set-up is: App.js will hold the application/use state while calling the hooks, 
    jobs.js will hold the component tree plus the render styling.


2) Create Front-End Part 2 with JSON Test- 5:15

3) Create cron Worker- 10:00
    Create a package JSON at root that will be accessible from all folders:
        npm init -y
    Add the cron dependency to run tasks on a timer:
        npm i cron
    Test to see if the cron worker functions properly when the Usage (basic cron usage)
    is added to the worker index:
        node worker/index.js
    The console message should show every second.


4) Iterate Through the Job Pages- 15:34
    Add the node fetch library from root:
        npm i node-fetch
    Check the number of pages within the fetch-github.js file:
        node worker/tasks/fetch-github.js

5) Loop Through the Jobs- 19:53
